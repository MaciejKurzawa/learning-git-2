    <h3>Logic & Marshmello - Everyday</h3>
    <p>Roll up to the spot, feelin' real good
Think you gon' talk shit, you better not, my homies real hood
They say, "Logic, why you do that?" I don't know, I don't know
Yeah, they used to be like, "Who that?" I don't know, I don't know
Now they know my name wherever I go
Used to think that's what I wanted, but now just don't know
No, I can't fuck with that, knuck if you buckin' back
Yeah, I been workin' but I ain't get nothin' back
Tell me the dealy now, hold up, wait, really now
All of that shit you been talkin' just silly now</p>
    
        <p>I work hard every motherfuckin' day-ay-ay-ayy
I work hard, I work hard every day-ay-ay-ayy, yeah
But today is my day, it's my day
And no matter what they say, it's my day
La-la-la-la-la-la, yeah</p>
